			 <strong><center><p style= "font-size: 15px"> This recipe actually came to me by mistake. My first time making a cheescake was filled with mess-ups and subsitute ingredients since I didn't have a lot of things needed for a normal cheesecake. Shockingly, my 2 wrongs made a right and I was able to make a dessert I could be proud of and serve to my family! The mishmatch of ingredients made a cheesecake that was light and creamy, and I hope you enjoy my happy accident! </p></center></strong>

                <ol>
                    <li>Mix your crushed biscuits and the melted butter together. While it's still warm, press it into your pan to form a leveled crust. Bake your crust for 8 min at 300&deg; and let it cool.</li>
					<li>As your crust is baking, let your cream cheese soften to room temperature, then whip the cream cheese until smooth.</li>
					<li>Add the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and as must or as little cinnamon sugar as you'd like and mix until smooth.</li>
					<li>Pour your cheesecake mix into the pan with your crust and let it set.</li>
					<li>Put in your airfryer and bake at 300&deg; for 30-35 minutes <strong>OR</strong> preheat your oven at 325&deg; and bake for 1 hour. </li>
					<li> Once finished, carefully remove the pan and put in the fridge to cool for 6-8 hours.</li>
					<li>Top with whatever drizzle you chose and cut with a warm knife. Enjoy your creation!</li>
