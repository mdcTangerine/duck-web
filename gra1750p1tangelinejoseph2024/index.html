					<li>Pour your cheesecake mix into the pan with your crust and let it set.</li>
					<li>Put in your airfryer and bake at 300&deg; for 30-35 minutes OR preheat your oven at 325&deg; and bake for 1 hour. </li>
					<li> Once finished, carefully remove the pan and put in the fridge to cool for 6-8 hours.</li>
					<li>Top with whatever drizzle you chose and cut with a warm knife and enjoy your creation!</li>
